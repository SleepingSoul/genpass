# genpass
Super simple tool for generating secure passwords. I was tired of using lastpass generator and decided to create a simple cmd tool for this task.

By default, it will generate password of 30 characters.
You can pass up to 2 arguments to this program:
- -ns to not use special characters and only use alphabet letters;
- {int} for specifying your own password length;
- -h for help.

Requires C++20.
